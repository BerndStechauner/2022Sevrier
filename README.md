# Optics Hands-On in Sevrier, November 2022
*H. Bartosik, D. Gamba,  G. Sterbini*

During the [CAS 2022 in Sevrier](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1126689/) (France), we will be using Python as scripting languages for the Optics Hands-On Lattice course.

This repository contains all material used during the course.
The repository is based on the material prepared and updated during previous courses by *W. Herr,  A. Latina, G. Sterbini*.

- [student_instructions.md](./student_instructions.md) contains all information to get ready for the course. We kindly ask the student to read this document **before coming** to CAS to **prepare yourself** (and **your laptop**) for the course. 
- [lecturer_instructions.md](./lecturer_instructions.md) contains some useful for the lecturer. 
- The overleaf repository can be found at https://www.overleaf.com/read/rqmgdrfgdcrs

> **NOTE:** the material in this repository is expected to evolve over time thanks to the feedback received from you! Please don't hesitate to transmit us your comments, suggestions, and complains!
